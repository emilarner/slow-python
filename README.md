# slow-python
The Slow Programming Language interpreter, written in Python.

*NOTE: This interpreter is very far from complete, meaning that it has not implemented the Slow Programming Language specification and only serves as a very shallow representation of the Slow Programming Language. For example, it has type names that are lower-case and which are not represented as objects--something that the specification contradicts. Along with the contradictions with the official specification of the language, this interpreter is riddled with bugs, bad programming practices, and errors which will inevitably arise in the future. The only .slow file that works in this repository is example.slow, which implements a for-loop from a while-loop and counts to 100--displaying SOME sort of usability.*

To run:
  *python main.py [your .slow file]*
